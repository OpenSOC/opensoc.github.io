    <section>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>The OpenSOC project is a collaborative open source development project dedicated to providing an extensible
         and scalable advanced security analytics tool.  It has strong foundations in the Apache Hadoop Framework and
         values collaboration for high-quality community-based open source development.</p>

      <p>The OpenSOC project has the following goals:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>To provide a collaborative open source community for development of an extensible and scalable advanced security analytics tool</li>

          <li>To encourage open communication for additional features and identification of deficiencies for a stable and functionally usable tool</li>

          <li>To identify key feature enhancements to drive technology efforts around efficient security analytics</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The OpenSOC project welcomes participation from all people and organizations for development, enhancements, and/or implementation support.</p>
      
      <h3>What is OpenSOC?</h3>

      <p>OpenSOC is a Big Data security analytics framework designed to consume and monitor network traffic and machine 
      exhaust data of a data center.  OpenSOC is extensible and is designed to work at a massive scale. 
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The framework provides the following capabilities:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Extensible spouts and parsers for attaching OpenSOC to monitor any telemetry source</li>
      <li>Extensible enrichment framework for any telemetry stream</li>
      <li>Anomaly detection and real-time rules-based alerts for any telemetry stream</li>
      <li>Hadoop-backed storage for telemetry stream with a customizable retention time</li>
      <li>Automated real-time indexin for telemetry streams backed by Elastic Search</li>
      <li>Telemetry correlation and SQL query capability for data stored in Hadoop backed by Hive</li>
      <li>ODBC/JDBC compatibility and integration with existing analytics tools</li>
      </ul>
      
 
      <p>OpenSOC is designed to scale up to consume millions of messages per second, enrich them, run them through anomaly
         detection algorithms, and issue real-time alerts.  
      </p>
      
      <h3>What do I need to run OpenSOC</h3>
      
      <ul>
      <li>2 Network Capture Cards (Recommend Napatech NT20E2-CAP)</li>
      <li>Apache Flume 1.4.0 +</li>
      <li>Apache Kafka 0.8.1+</li>
      <li>Apache Storm 0.9 +</li>
      <li>Apache Hadoop 2.x (any distribution)</li>
      <li>Apache Hive 12 + (13 recommended)</li>
      <li>Apache Hbase 0.94+ </li>
      <li>Elastic Search 1.1 +</li>
      <li>MySQL 5.6+ </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Components</h3>

      <p>OpenSOC consists of the following repositories
     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSOC/opensoc.github.io/master/images/open_source_summary.png" alt="OpenSOC Overview">
      <ul>
      <li><b>Platform:</b>this repository is dedicated to installation and automation scripts for platform configurations
          This includes ready-made images for one-click OpenSOC installs.  Additionally we will provide the scripts
          for automating installations for Geo, Whois, and CIF enrichment sources
      </li>
      <li><b>Telemetry:</b>this repository will consist of software to capture and ingest packets off the wire into kafka, 
        software to parse out layer 3-7 metadata from packet headers, and Flume agent configurations to capture any
        additional telemetry and pipe into Apache Kafka.  Additionally this repository will have Storm bolts for 
        parsing, enriching, and alerting on the telemetry.  The scripts for storing data in Hive will also be provided
      </li>
      <li><b>Analytics:</b>this repository will have statistical models and machine learning algorithms for anomaly
        detection of telemetry streams.  It will additionally have the service for packet query and reconstruction into 
        PCAP from HBase store
      </li>
      <li><b>UI:</b>this repository will contain web analytics applications written to work with the OpenSOC platform.
      Each application may have additional set of dependencies (which will be outlined in the installation instructions)
      </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
